= Log4J2 - trying out

I came to a conclusion that it would be worth it having a separate project just to try out Log4J2-related stuff.

So this is it.

This is also not a bad starting template for a typical Java Maven project.

[source,powershell]
----
mvn package
java -jar .\target\log4j2-tryout-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== Dev-related

=== JShell

I tried using https://github.com/johnpoth/jshell-maven-plugin[`jshell-maven-plugin`]
so I could familiarize myself interactively with APIs I use.
It proved to be quite useful -- it prepares the JShell REPL with all the dependencies
from `pom.xml` loaded and ready to be imported.

The command to launch it is:

[source,powershell]
----
mvn jshell:run
----

=== Code coverage

Just run

[source, powershell]
----
mvn test
mvn jacoco:report
----

and then open the `/target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

To see coverage provided by a single test, run:

[source,powershell]
----
mvn clean test -Dtest=EnhancedCellTest
mvn jacoco:report
----
